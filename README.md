## Description

**Wolof** is a language spoken in Senegal in neighboring countries, many works are written in Wolof or the need to have a tool that allows us to know better this language. 

This is how the idea of the **Wolof library** was born, which allows us to do several specific tasks in Wolof languages such as text classification, automatic translation, but also automatic speech recognition.
